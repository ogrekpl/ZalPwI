Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has moved companies' business to the Internet, which has further influenced the rapid expansion of CRM systems, and thus Salesforce. The big advantage of this system is the high possibility of customization to customer requirements. A large part of the customer's requirements can be handled with partially ready-made \"out-of-box\" solutions.",
